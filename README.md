# Automata: A Conway's Game of Life Variant

This is Automata, a Golang implementation of Conway's Game of Life with a twist! This program simulates the evolution of cellular automata, where the next state of a cell depends on its current state and the states of its neighbors.

## Features:

* Classic Conway's Game of Life rules.
* Visual representation of the cellular automata grid.

## Instructions:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Golang installed and configured on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official [Golang website](https://go.dev/).

2. Clone the Repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KalebHawkins/automata.git
```

3. Build the Program:

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```shell
go build
```

This will create an executable file named automata.

4. Run the Program:

Execute the program:

```shell
./automata
```


This will start the simulation.

<!-- ## Further Customization (Optional):

Briefly describe any features that allow customization of the simulation (e.g., grid size, initial state, custom rules). -->
